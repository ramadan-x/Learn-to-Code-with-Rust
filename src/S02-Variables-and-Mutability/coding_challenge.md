# Coding Challenge: Variables and Mutability

## Task 1: String Variable with Type Annotation

Declare a `season` variable set to a string with your favorite season. Provide an explicit type annotation. The type of a string is a `&str`. We'll discuss what the & symbol means later in the course.

## Task 2: Integer Variable with Type Annotation

Declare a `points_scored` variable set to 28. Provide an explicit type annotation. The type of an integer is `i32`.

## Task 3: Team Name and Mutable Variables

Declare a `team_name` variable set to a string with your favorite sports team.

It's time to update the team's score. Declare the `points_scored` variable to be mutable. Set its new value to 35.

## Task 4: Constants

Declare a `TOUCHDOWN_POINTS` constant at the file level set to the value 6.

## Task 5: Event Time Variable

Declare a `event_time` variable set to a string of "06:00".

## Task 6: Variable Shadowing

Use variable shadowing to redeclare `event_time` set to an integer of 6.

## Task 7: String Interpolation

Use interpolation to print out all of the declared variables and constants in a println! call. Practice with direct interpolation, sequential arguments, and numeric arguments.

## Task 8: Underscore for Unused Variables

Declare a `favorite_beverage` variable set to a string of your favorite drink. Use an underscore to silence the compiler warning about the variable being unused.

## Task 9: Compiler Directive

Remove the underscore. Provide a compiler directive to silence the compiler warning about the variable being unused.

# Coding Challenge: Data Types

## Task 1: Integer Variable with Visual Separator

Declare an i32 variable assigned to 1337. Use the underscore character to add a visual separator between the numbers.

## Task 2: Type Casting

Cast the i32 to an i16 integer and assign the result to a separate variable.

## Task 3: Floating-Point with Precision

Declare a floating-point value of your choosing. Print out the number with 3 digits of precision.

## Task 4: Boolean Variables

Declare a `with_milk` variable set to a Boolean.
Declare a `with_sugar` variable set to a Boolean.

## Task 5: Logical AND Operation

Declare a `is_my_type_of_coffee` variable. It should be set to true if the coffee has both milk and sugar.

## Task 6: Logical OR Operation

Declare an `is_acceptable_coffee` variable. It should be set to true if the coffee has either milk or sugar.

## Task 7: Array Declaration and Debug Output

Declare an array with four i8 integers of your choosing. Print out the array in its Debug representation.

## Task 8: Tuple Declaration and Debug Output

Declare a tuple consisting of the integer, float, a Boolean, and the array that you previously declared. Print out the tuple in its Debug representation.

# Coding Challenge: Control Flow

## Task 1: Color to Number Function with If Statements

Define a `color_to_number` function that accepts a 'color' parameter (a string). Use if, else if, and else statements to return a corresponding numeric value based on the following rules:

1. If the color is "red", return 1.
2. If the color is "green", return 2.
3. If the color is "blue", return 3.
4. If the color is any other string, return 0.

## Task 2: Refactor with Match Statement

Refactor the function above to use the `match` statement instead of if, else if, and else.

## Task 3: Factorial Function

Define a `factorial` function that calculates the factorial of a number. The factorial is the product of multiplying a number by every incremental number leading up to it, starting from 1.

### Examples

- The factorial of 5 is 5 \* 4 \* 3 \* 2 \* 1 = 120
- factorial(5) should return 120.
- The factorial of 4 is 4 \* 3 \* 2 \* 1 = 24
- factorial(4) should return 24.

### Implementation Requirements

Implement two solutions/functions for the problem:

1. The first solution should not use recursion.
2. The second solution should use recursion.
